•	Routes: Defined routes for each quiz page, ensuring a structured and dynamic application flow.
•	Logging: Implemented thorough logging for debugging and monitoring application behavior.
•	Functions & Arrow Functions: Utilized JavaScript functions, including the concise arrow function syntax.
•	Axios: Employed Axios for smooth API requests to the Spring Boot backend, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
•	Asynchronous Programming: Delved into async and await to manage asynchronous operations, particularly beneficial during API calls.
•	React Router DOM: Facilitated navigation with React Router DOM, keeping UI in sync with the URL.
•	useHistory & useLocation: Navigated through components using useHistory for programmatic navigation and useLocation for accessing the current URL.
•	Spring Boot Backend:
•	Controller: Directed traffic between the frontend and backend, managing HTTP requests.
•	Service: Orchestrated business logic, ensuring separation of concerns.
•	Entity: Defined the data model, representing objects stored in the database.
•	Repository: Interacted with the MySQL database, handling data access logic.
•	CSS & Designing:
•	CSS Styling: Crafted an engaging and visually appealing user interface with CSS styling.
•	Responsive Design: Ensured a seamless user experience across devices through responsive design principles.
•	Design Thinking: Incorporated design thinking principles, focusing on user-centric design for an intuitive and enjoyable experience.
•	Research Process:
•	Thorough Research: Conducted extensive research to understand user expectations and industry best practices.
•	UI/UX Research: Explored UI/UX trends to implement modern and user-friendly design elements.
•	Tech Stack Research: Investigated and selected the optimal tech stack to meet project requirements.
•	Git & Git GUI:
•	Version Control: Maintained clean code and collaboration with Git, ensuring version control and collaboration.
•	Git GUI: Explored Git GUI for a user-friendly, interactive interface to manage Git repositories.

Postman for API Development:
•	API Creation: Utilized Postman to design and create APIs, ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend.
•	Testing: Conducted thorough testing of APIs to guarantee reliability and functionality.


•	💡 Backend Flow:
1.	React: Initiated requests through Axios, seamlessly interacting with the Spring Boot backend.
2.	Spring Boot: Processed requests through controllers, executed business logic in services, and interacted with the database through repositories.
1.	Controller: Receives requests from the frontend, orchestrating the flow.
2.	Service: Executes business logic, coordinating with repositories for data access.
3.	Repository: Manages data access, communicating with the MySQL database.
3.	MySQL: Stored and retrieved data based on backend requests, ensuring efficient data management.

👨‍💻 How Postman Helped:
•	API Design: Leveraged Postman for intuitive API design, ensuring clear communication between frontend and backend.
•	Testing Efficiency: Conducted efficient API testing, guaranteeing robustness and reliability in data transactions.

👨‍💻 Lessons Learned:

•	Explored advanced JavaScript features for more efficient and readable code.
•	Enhanced user experience with React Router, enabling seamless navigation.
•	Implemented a robust backend structure using Spring Boot and MySQL for scalable and efficient data management.
•	Embraced design thinking principles for an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
•	Navigated CORS configurations for seamless frontend-backend integration.
•	Implemented robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
•	Leveraged Git and Git GUI for efficient version control and collaboration..

🚀 Next Steps:
